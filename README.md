# ✨ Greetings, Fellow Coder! ✨

My name is Quoc Anh and I'm a full-stack developer.

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- 🏋️ Working out

- 🎮 Gaming

- 📚 Continuously learning and improving my software engineering knowledge

What I'm Up To

Currently exploring new technologies and building projects that make a difference. I'm keen on open-source and self-hosted solutions, aligning with a more independent and secure digital life. My aim is to grow professionally, earn more, and ultimately live a better life through my skills and dedication.
